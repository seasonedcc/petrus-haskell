# hamsterdan-testing benchmarks

These benchmarks time the oracle a deterministic simulation consults at every
checkpoint. The inputs are the 1658 documents of `test/corpus/oracle.jsonl`
that the reference admits. Each operation runs one pass over all of them:

- **evaluate:** `ReadinessModel().evaluate(facts)` on already-loaded facts.
- **load and evaluate:** `ReadinessFacts.load(json_text)` (strict
  validation), then `evaluate`.
- **liveness:** `evaluate_liveness` for each expectation, under the corpus's
  six environments and both budget flags (12 calls per document).

## Results

The machine was an Apple M4 (10 cores), macOS 26.3.1, shared with other
work. The load average was 2.1–2.5 during these runs (`uptime` before and
after each run).

- **Haskell:** GHC 9.10.3 with `-O2`, `tasty-bench`, run with `+RTS -M2G`.
  Each cell is that benchmark's mean.
- **Python:** CPython 3.14.6 with pydantic 2.13.4. Each cell is the best of 5
  `timeit` repeats, each about half a second of passes.
- **Interleaving:** two rounds, run as Haskell, Python, then Python, Haskell.
  The table shows each side's better round.

| Operation (one pass, 1658 documents) | Haskell | Python | Python / Haskell |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `evaluate` | 826 µs | 9.57 ms | 11.6× |
| `load` + `evaluate` | 17.3 ms | 29.1 ms | 1.7× |
| `evaluate_liveness` ×12 | 122 µs | 2.78 ms | 22.8× |

Haskell is faster on every row.

The Haskell `evaluate` forces the whole verdict: subject, generation,
readiness, disposition, every blocker, and every violation. The Python
`evaluate` also validates the `ReadinessExpectation` it builds. The Haskell
`load` runs the strict codec, including every `__post_init__` rule.

## Rerun

From the repository root, alternating the two sides:

<!-- scripts/bench: rerun -->
```sh
cabal bench hamsterdan-testing -j2 --benchmark-options='+RTS -M2G -RTS'
"$(scripts/upstream-python hamsterdan)" -I -B packages/hamsterdan-testing/bench/bench.py
```

`scripts/bench hamsterdan-testing` runs exactly this block once;
`scripts/upstream-python hamsterdan` provisions the pinned Hamsterdan.

Haskell times are wall-clock time (`localOption WallTime` in `bench/Main.hs`),
like the Python side's `time.perf_counter`. The table above was taken before
that switch, in tasty-bench's default CPU time; this workload is
single-threaded and does no I/O inside the timed region, so the two agree
(see [CPU and wall-clock time](../../../docs/reproducing.md#cpu-and-wall-clock-time)).

Note `uptime` before and after each run.
